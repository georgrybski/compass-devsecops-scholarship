### AWS Migration Budget for Fast Engineering S/A

This project provides detailed documentation on the migration and modernization budget for Fast Engineering S/A's infrastructure to AWS. The documentation is divided into two phases:

1. **As-Is (Lift-and-Shift)**  
   Covers the initial migration of on-premises resources to AWS using AWS MGN and AWS DMS. It includes planning, the tools used, the infrastructure diagram, security requirements, backup process, and cost estimate.


2. **AWS Modernization (EKS and Managed Services)**  
   Outlines the plan to modernize the infrastructure using Kubernetes (Amazon EKS) and managed services. It details the CI/CD setup, auto-scaling, monitoring, security, and backup processes.

For further details, please refer to the [**Migration Budget Documentation**](final_project_budget/final_project_budget) available in this repository.
