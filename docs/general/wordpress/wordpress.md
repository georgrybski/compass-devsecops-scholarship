# WordPress Overview

WordPress is a popular content management system (CMS) powering millions of websites. Containerizing WordPress with Docker offers benefits such as improved scalability, easier management, and isolation.

## Key Points
- **User-Friendly:** Intuitive interface for managing content.
- **Customizable:** A vast ecosystem of themes and plugins.
- **Scalable:** Can be horizontally scaled with load balancing and auto scaling.
- **Persistent Storage:** In containerized environments, external storage (like AWS EFS) ensures that data (uploads, plugins, themes) is not lost during container updates.

For additional insights into containerized WordPress deployments, please consult the [official WordPress documentation](https://wordpress.org/support/).
